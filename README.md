## About the [Equalithon](https://www.equalithon.io/equalithon-list/event-five-tra87-2y2s9-tnyam-npsnf-gr4aa-em8dr-gtpg2-zha6k-asw7e-hzs9d-6r9fp-g6m25-b3l4f-934l2-e9nj6-wfkpw-nx3c8-9nkmb)

> **SPI's vision:** A world where race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, class & country of origin, no longer separate us.

> **Team challenge:** How can we create a virtual community for SafePlace International‚Äôs DREAM academy graduates to safely share their stories, connect & interact with each other.

### Pain Points - [SafePlace International](https://www.safeplaceinternational.org/)

- Rapidly growing community - hard to keep track of **communication & connection** within the communities
- Hoping to increase member retention and engagement after members graduate from the **DREAM academy**
- In need of a virtual community for members to **share triumphs, pursue further professional development, broadcast their journeys, and to report instances of violence/discrimination.**

### How can we help?

#### We think that by creating the SPI virtual community we can foster an environment for DREAM academy members to find each other and connect safely.

### Solutions

- Color scheme - matches SPI site
- Login/Sign up page
  - DREAM academy members/graduates only
  - **Access code** given to members by SPI leaders to sign up (promotes safety)
- Newsfeed interactions (posts with images, likes, comments)
  - A community for members to interact with one another
- Testimonials
  - Option to be anonymous
- Profile layout
  - Edit profile feature - all fields are optional
  - Date/time stamp of when profiles were updated public
- Report form & confirmation
  - Report status (open/closed) ‚Üí SPI DREAM academy member may see status of report

### Pain Points - [Team](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenipapanicolas/overlay/urn:li:fsd_profileProject:(ACoAABSqiLABn-PDAsO4qRd0yATIVhZ2GsIQxNc,996935969)/creators/>)

- Newsfeed
  - How did we want our community to be able to interact with each other?
    - Inspired by facebook, reddit, instagram
- Tagging feature
  - Meant to serve as another mode for connection
  - Too many ideas for this feature - groups, testimonials, user profile
- Testimonials
  - How do we want users to interact with this feature? (comments? likes?)
- Filing a report
  - Status of report: How to determine if report was seen, handled, etc.
- Groups & direct messages features
  - Designs were made but not enough time to develop these features.
  - Another way for members to directly relate & connect with each other
- Code:
  - Database association hurdles (SQL vs. noSQL database)
  - User authentication with jwt tokens
  - Forgo developing groups & DM‚Äôs feature

### Future Directions

- Community guideline page
- Mentorship & employment opportunities
- Reactions on comments (show support, care, interest)
- Tags (additional features - group creation)
- Newsfeed (share posts/DM friends)
  - Pin most relevant comment
- Comments within comments feature for posts
- Extra security & privacy features
